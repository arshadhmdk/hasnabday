I do not love you as salt-rose or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off... I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret...between the shadow and the soul

Thank you for being my unpaid therapist.

I fell in love with our friendship the way you fall asleep...slowly and then all at once</p>
